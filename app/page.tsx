              Tourists frequently face safety issues such as getting lost in unfamiliar locations, road accidents,
              harassment, scams, or delayed help during medical emergencies. Existing systems lack real-time monitoring,
              geo-fencing alerts, structured incident reporting, and coordinated authority response. As a result, both
              tourists and authorities are left without a reliable safety net, reducing confidence in tourism
              infrastructure and impacting local economies.
